# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview

After a trip to New York City with our friend Kate, we realized one of the best parts of the trip was the Citi Bike program. This bike service allowed us to explore the city and enjoy many different attractions. Due to this experience, we wanted to research the program to see if we could adapt the service to our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. We used the August 2019 data provided by the Citi Bike website. This data allowed us to discover trends and insights into the New York program. 

## Results

We have gathered our data in our [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elizabeth.cotter/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis_16758849877630/CitiBikeAnalysis) and also will provide an explanation below: 

First, we reviewed basic demographics:

Then, we analyzed the length of rides, the majority were around 5-6 minutes long. On average, a ride this long will be about 1 mile.

After, we broke the data down further to show the trip time by gender. Male and Female users had a similar trip time pattern, which was aligned with the overall data of 5-6 minutes. Unknown genders traveled 5-25 minutes.

Then, we reviewed the data for start times and stop times, we can see that peak times are during traditional commute hours. One point of interest is that Wednesday evenings showed lower ridership than other weeknights.

To gain further insights, we took the start times and stop times, but breaking them down by gender shows a similar story for Female and Male riders. Unknown riders show more use on weekends, followed by early evening hours.

Finally, we reviewed days of the week, gender, and usertype data. We see that Male Subscribers are the highest use group. Female Subscribers seem to be the second highest use group. The Unknown gender Customers are more active than Unknown gender Subscribers.

## Summary

We have been able to show our potential Angel Investors some valuable information about the Citi Bike program in New York. We feel that this is a great presentation to build confidence in bringing the program to the Des Moines market. We have some recommendations for further review and would consider including them in our presentation. 

First, in order to determine if this is a good strategy for Des Moines, we should review the following: 

1. Des Moines demographics
2. Des Moines neighborhoods and commute patterns
3. Popular places and activities in Des Moines, with the distance to residential and hotel areas
4. Tourism data and patterns 

With this information, we can better propose our ideas to the Angel Investors. Additionally, this research will help to plan our bike resources properly when the idea comes to fruition. 

Furthermore, some visualizations from the existing data that will be helpful are: 
1. A graph that shows common start/stop patterns. This could show where bikes will need to be at certain times of day.
2. A graph to show start/stop times and trip duration. Is there any correlation between certain destinations and length of trip? 

Overall, we are excited about the prospect of bringing this type of program to Des Moines!
